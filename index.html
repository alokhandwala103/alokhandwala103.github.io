  <h1>Relation between Prime and Fibonacci numbers and its physical interpretation</h1>
<p><strong><em>May 14th, 2019</em> by Aziz Lokhandwala</strong></p>
<h2>Abstract: Prime numbers are the numbers which represents something random, while fibonacci numbers denote a stable phenomena in form of spirals. But is their any relation between them, Yep it's their and I will share that amazing relation and its physical interpretation which has been verified by Holger Bech Nielsen to you.</h2>

<center><p><strong>2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 ...(i)</strong></p></center>
<center><p><em>1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ...(ii)</em></p></center>
<p>On adding/subtracting (i) and (ii) element to element you have:</p>
<center><p><strong>3 4 7 10 16 21 30 40 ...(iii)</strong></p></center>
<center><p><em>1 2 3 4 6 5 4 -2 ...(iv)</em></p></center>
<p>On doing product of (iii) and (iv) and (i) and (ii) you have:</p>
<center><p><strong>3 8 21 40 96 105 120 -80</strong></p></center>
<center><p><em>2 3 10 21 55 104 221 399</em></p></center>
<p>On subtracting above two you have:</p>
<center><p>1 5 11 19 41 1 -101 479 ...(v)</p></center>
<p><em>On observing equation (v) we can conclude that when two phenomenon like thunderstorm and the surrounding atmosphere we see that the resultant is sometimes fine and sometimes random and it's also obvious that fine phenomenon probability is less while randomness probability is more and this fact can be seen from equation (v) i.e when it is '1' it represents fine phenomena and when it is a prime number it represents a random phenomena which is observe in daily life in calamities like tornado, etc...</em></p>
